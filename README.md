# Microsoft Exchange Security - Public Contents and Microsoft Sentinel Solution Readme page

## DATA Collection

We build the solution to give you the possibility to collect multiple logs and configurations reports following your needs and the quantity of logs you want to upload to Microsoft Sentinel.

To do that, we create the concept of "Option" with a mandatory root part that give you a visibility of what can be usefull for you.

### Root part - Security Configuration

This part rely on the Exchange Security Insights On-Premises Collector for *On-Premises environments* and Exchange Security Insights Online Collector for *Online environments*.

This root part collects Security configuration, RBAC Information and Mailbox Audit information to create the Security and RBAC Insights in Workbooks.
